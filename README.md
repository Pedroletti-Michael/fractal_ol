# fractal_ol
This depot was created to contains all file of my project 42_fract_ol of the cursuus 42 Lausanne.

In this project we need to create a program who can draw some fractal.
We use the minilibX, this program should only work on macOSX operating system.

We have some obligations, we can use only these function :
•	open,		close,	read,	write,
	printf,		malloc,	free,	perror,
	strerror,	exit
•All functions of the math
library (-lm man man 3 math)
•All functions of the MinilibX



Some link that help me during the creation of this project :
- https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/libs/minilibx/introduction.html
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fractals_by_Hausdorff_dimension
- https://journals.openedition.org/cybergeo/27164
- https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/41469
- https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_de_Mandelbrot
- http://mathematiques.ac-dijon.fr/sources/traam/julia.pdf



Things needed to do :
1. learn more about creation of fractal
2. learn more about drawing with minilibx library
3. start the project
