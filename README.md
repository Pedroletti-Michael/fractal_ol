# fractal_ol
First thing, I wrote in english to practice, so it's possible that all my text are not totally understandable, don't hesitate to contact me and give me some feedbacks to improve it.

This depot was created to contains all file of my project 42_fract_ol of the cursuus 42 Lausanne.
I can choose beetween 3 project, so_long, FdF and fract-ol. I choose fract-ol because this project is the most
interesting for me and I wanted to know more about fractals, which is for me some fascinants geometricals forms.

In this project we need to create a program who can draw some fractal.
The program must display the Mandelbrot set and Julia set.
We use the minilibX, this program should only work on macOSX operating system.

We have some obligations, we can use only these function :
•	open,		close,	read,	write,
	printf,		malloc,	free,	perror,
	strerror,	exit
•All functions of the math
library (-lm man man 3 math)
•All functions of the MinilibX

Things needed to do :
1. learn more about creation of fractal
2. learn more about drawing with minilibx library
3. start the project
